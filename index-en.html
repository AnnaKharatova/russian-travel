        <p class="intro__text">According to VTsIOM polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere, but only 36% plan to
          spend a vacation in their native country. Like, what haven't we seen here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole
          universe with the gentle sea of the south, the dense forests of the Sayan Mountains and the harsh ice of the
          Putorana plateau. And you can also see all these beauties without millions on the account, a passport and many
          hours of flights. Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova-a brave young mother who took three children in her arms,
          put them in her Lada and drove 20 thousand kilometers around her native country. We have selected and
          described some interesting places worthy of your vacation.</p>

            <p class="place__paragraph">The Kaliningrad Region does not end there. For the traveler and explorer, there
              is also a scattering of small seaside towns in the same neighborhood — the westernmost point of Russia,
              the Baltic Spit, and the German heritage. The atmosphere of these places eliminates the hustle and bustle,
              immersing you in the tranquility of nature and the smell of the steel, cool sea.</p>

              apatites have long been a source of apathy. But your dream of seeing the Northern Lights starts to come
              true with a ticket to Murmansk.</p>

            <p class="place__paragraph">Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia. First of all, because of
              the mountains: if you go along the ridge, you will see slopes strewn with pine trees, mountain rivers and
              lakes. And if you open the car windows, you will be able to get acquainted with the invisible miracle of
              these places-the mountain air.</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">The climate in Altai is temperate, so it is best to go here in the summer. So
              you will see all the variety of local flora and fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over
              the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous Manuls are also inhabitants of the Altai
              Territory.</p>

              Everyone knows Baikal as the largest lake
              in the world. Many also know that this is the largest source of fresh water and one
              of the most beautiful places in Russia.</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">Of course, this is all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place
              for skioring competitions. This is a kind of sport when a skier ties himself to a motorcycle, and the
              tandem tries to develop as much speed as possible on the ice. In March 2019 at the festival
              &laquo;Baikal Mile&raquo; was set a world record&nbsp;&mdash; 197.011&nbsp;km/h.</p>

              for 30 meters, the forests of Karelian national parks have never known an axe because of impassable
              swamps. Some pines are already more than half a millennium old. Touch a living being who
              saw the sun before Ivan the Terrible saw it. There are no trails for a hundred kilometers in the virgin
              forest. And on rare paths, trees in a couple of meters from the ground are marked
              with bear claws. So that everyone knows who is the boss here.</p>
